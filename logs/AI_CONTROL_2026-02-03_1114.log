==== AI SESSION SUMMARY ====
Task:            CONTROL
End:             02/03/2026 11:14:00

Actions performed:
Created session wrapper: C:\AI_Scripts\AI.Run.ps1
Started CONTROL session with enforced elevation + Process-scope ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Captured transcript to paired transcript file

System changes made:
Created files under C:\AI_Scripts and C:\AI_Logs only
No registry/services/scheduled tasks changed

Risks introduced:
Transcripts can capture sensitive command/output; treat C:\AI_Logs as sensitive.

Rollback notes:
Delete wrapper: Remove-Item C:\AI_Scripts\AI.Run.ps1 -Force
Delete logs/transcripts: Remove-Item C:\AI_Logs\AI_CONTROL_* -Force

Outstanding issues / next steps:
Next task: TOOLKIT - create reusable helper scripts (safe copy, hash verify, diff, quick health checks) + standard task scaffolding.
