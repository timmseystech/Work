==== AI SESSION SUMMARY ====
Task:            TOOLKIT
End:             02/03/2026 11:16:32

Actions performed:
Validated fixed session wrapper via CONTROL2 run (header log clean, transcript separated)
Smoke-tested helper scripts: AI.Hash, AI.CopySafe, AI.DiffText, AI.Health
Created temp working dir: C:\AI_Scripts\_tmp

System changes made:
Created CONTROL2 log/transcript in C:\AI_Logs
Created temp files in C:\AI_Scripts\_tmp
Created HEALTH log in C:\AI_Logs

Risks introduced:
Transcripts/logs may capture sensitive output; treat C:\AI_Logs as sensitive.

Rollback notes:
Remove temp: Remove-Item C:\AI_Scripts\_tmp -Recurse -Force
Remove CONTROL2 artifacts: Remove-Item C:\AI_Logs\AI_CONTROL2_* -Force
Remove HEALTH log(s): Remove-Item C:\AI_Logs\AI_HEALTH_* -Force

Outstanding issues / next steps:
Next task: TASKSCAFFOLD - build a standard task runner that:
- starts session (header+transcript),
- runs a provided scriptblock,
- stops transcript,
- writes summary automatically.
