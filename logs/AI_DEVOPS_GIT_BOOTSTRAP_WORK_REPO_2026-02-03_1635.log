==== AI SESSION SUMMARY ====
Task:            DEVOPS_GIT_BOOTSTRAP_WORK_REPO
End:             02/03/2026 16:35:02

Actions performed:
Cloned empty repo and bootstrapped it with README + .gitignore.
Created first commit on main using work identity and SSH signing settings.
Pushed main to GitHub and set upstream tracking.

System changes made:
Created/updated in repo: README.md, .gitignore, folders src/ and docs/.
New root commit created and pushed to origin/main.

Risks introduced:
Minimal: repo now has an initial commit and default branch (main).

Rollback notes:
To remove initial commit (DANGEROUS if others start using it):
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main

Outstanding issues / next steps:
Optional hardening: enable branch protection + require signed commits.
Optional hygiene: add .gitattributes for line endings; add LICENSE.
