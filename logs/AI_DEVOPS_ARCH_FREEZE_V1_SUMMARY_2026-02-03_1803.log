==== AI SESSION SUMMARY ====
Task:            DEVOPS_ARCH_FREEZE_V1_SUMMARY
End:             02/03/2026 18:03:55

Actions performed:
Created docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/INVARIANTS.md describing the v1.0 baseline.
Committed docs and tagged arch/v1.0 (annotated tag).
Created a pinned save state 'arch-v1.0-freeze' and pushed logs/index/tag.

System changes made:
Repo changes: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/INVARIANTS.md committed.
Git tag: arch/v1.0 created (or already existed).
Save state: arch-v1.0-freeze added (logs + index + ai-state tag).

Risks introduced:
Low. Documentation + tags only. Save-state adds logs/index entries.

Rollback notes:
Delete tag: git tag -d arch/v1.0; git push --delete origin arch/v1.0
Revert docs commit: git revert <commit>
Delete save-state tag: git tag -d ai-state/arch-v1.0-freeze; git push --delete origin ai-state/arch-v1.0-freeze
Revert save-state commit: git revert <commit>

Outstanding issues / next steps:
(Recommended) Add ARCHITECTURE.md link to README.md.
(Optional) Migrate profile functions into scripts/ai-functions.ps1 for cleanliness.
