==== AI SESSION SUMMARY ====
Task:            DEVOPS_SSH
End:             02/03/2026 11:51:51

Actions performed:
Generated ed25519 keypair: id_ed25519_github
Enabled and started ssh-agent (StartupType=Manual)
Loaded key into agent
Configured ~/.ssh/config for github.com IdentityFile
Attempted GitHub auth; current status: GitHub rejected key (not yet associated with account)

System changes made:
Created ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github and .pub
Updated ~/.ssh/config (backup created if existing)
Set ssh-agent service StartupType to Manual and started it
Adjusted ACLs on key files

Risks introduced:
Private key exists locally; protect it.
Agent holds key in memory while running.

Rollback notes:
Disable agent: Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Disabled; Stop-Service ssh-agent
Remove keypair: Remove-Item ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github* -Force
Restore config from ~/.ssh/config.bak_*

Outstanding issues / next steps:
After GitHub key is added: test 'ssh -T git@github.com' until success, then optionally:
- clone a repo via SSH
- add per-host entries for GitLab/Bitbucket
